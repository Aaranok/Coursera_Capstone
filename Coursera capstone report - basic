https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_and_neighborhoods_of_Los_Angeles => data regarding the various neighbourhoods of LA

http://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/d6c55385a0e749519f238b77135eafac_0/geoservice => smaller dataset of the LA neighbourhoods, with the posibility of getting a map of the city+districts

https://simplemaps.com/data/us-zips => data of the usps zip codes(along with location data long-lat for each), has to be sifted for relevant information, .csv file uploaded to github and then retrived from there into the project notebook 



Data regarding the cities in the Los Angeles greater metropolitan area will be aquired and then used to cluster them based on the popular venues( venue information taken from Foursquare ). Based on these clusters a good area for a new cofee shop will be chosen.

The criteria will be:
    1 - there is no cofee shop in the top 3 most popular venues in the cluster( competition would be too great as there are a number of well established coffee shops )
    2 - there is no restuarant( other than fast food ) in the top 3 most popular venues in the cluster( restaurants offer drinks, a coffee shop would find again far too much competition )
    3 - there is another coffee shop in the top 10 most popular venues( the market for such a venue is there, however it is not saturated or dominated )
    4 - there is some form of restaurant in the top 10 most popular venues( there may be demand for a dedicated coffee shop )
    5 - there is some form of outdoor activities venue ( parks and such, people may like a coffe before or after a pleasant stroll )
    6 - if 5 does not apply, there have to be shops or other busineses in the cluster in the top 5 most popular

Clusters will be created by using k-means clustering. The resulting clusters can then be used for checking different venues for suitability by adapting the criteria mentioned above. The program also contains population data for each city, as such profitability may be judged at a later date. A map of the clusters will also be created to help in choosing the location.
